  description: '"Hello? HELLO?! CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?? We are a survivor group on
    the edge of the city. We have just been hit. Many are dead, resources have dwindled.
    If you are hearing this PLEASE come to us, do NOT listen to the corrupt military
    messages telling you to stay put. You are safe with us. We have a working in-shelter
    hospital, we have food. Please come help us prosper."'
